It's for people like me who have dreams, big dreams, but don't have the audacity to do something good with their lives. I know how hard and frustrating it could be when you actually dream to do something big but just cannot. That late night motivation that I'll start tomorrow is never gonna come true. Trust me. You're not alone. I'm the same person as like you, and I can promise there're millions like us. Stop feeling yourself as a looser. \n\nWe are not the problem, but if we don't take any measure we'll forever be trapped in the rat race. This middle-class life is shit. Trust me. You may be wondering who's this fucking anonymous writer lecturing us? I'm nothing, and yes, who am I to lecture you? I'm not lecturing. I'm sharing what I have learnt, and what I'll do to make my life better. Becoming even 1% better is true. It won't cost you a million dollars to wake a bit early, read some pages of a non-fiction book, talk to a neighbor or a cashier in a friendly tone, go for a run, or even just posting about your experience. \n\nThere's so much to do, but we're trapped. I'm not gonna be. I promise. I can't swear how much time it's gonna take, what I'll do, or even if I would even make it to the top 5%(not a goal, yeah. It never was.) Making money shouldn't be the end goal. I mean it. The inner satisfaction you get when you see yourself enjoying the phase, waking early, never missing a workout, or a Duolingo lesson. That's real happiness. I'm not gonna bore you guys with a ton of nonsense. But yes, trust me, I can show you how a guy like me, with no special talent is gonna reform, and perform!",
